I abandoned this project in 2008, but multiple people have requested access to
the source code, so here it is. Unfortunately I did not use source control back
then, so it is a bit of mess – part of the reason why I abandoned the project.

This history is reconstructed from source snapshots I made back then. If you
want to compile the project, the v0.3.0 commit is probably your best bet. The
commit after that is from the middle of a larger rewrite that I never finished.
I don’t think it will compile and there is most likely a lot of work required to
fix that.

This source code is released under GPL v2. I would be very happy if this project
doesn’t have to rot in its grave and somebody picks it up again. If you need
any help doing that, feel free to contact me.
